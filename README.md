# Dirty Napkin
- I (Noah) configured prepros for myself, feel free to setup codekit and have the config file here
- Be sure to fetch and pull from the desktop app (or vscode integration) and create a pull request before making changes
- `placeholder.txt` files are just because github wouldn't commit empty folders, feel free to delete them when adding something
