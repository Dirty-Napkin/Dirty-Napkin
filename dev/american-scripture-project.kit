Holding respectful conversations with those who disagree can be uncomfortable, but exploring texts and history opens people up to ideas that help us find common ground.</h5>

            <p class="width2 vert-center">American Scripture Project is a national curriculum that cultivates civil discourse by using methods of religious text study to investigate historic American texts. The goal is to talk about big issues, unite over the shared experience of being American, and remind us that we are all in this democracy together.</p>

            <p class="width6 narrow-text">The logo is riddled with iconic symbolism, from the repeated lines of the American flag to the Statue of Liberty’s crown. It is tied together by the lines that emanate from the dog-eared corner, representing how each participant will take away something unique and spiritually impactful.</p>

            <p class="width2">We drew inspiration from archival immigration paperwork and government forms that include delicate grid lines and excessive stamping . We designed a system of custom stamps with misaligned letters of varying weights and spacings that reference the hasty Ellis Island printing techniques.</p>
