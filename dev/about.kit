                <span class="txtbold">When you share your story</span> with another person, you are inviting them into your world, and in doing so, you build a larger community of people with shared worlds. That perspective is what creates connection– with individuals and with&nbsp;brands.

                When we first started Dirty Napkin in 2023, we hardly knew the difference between a font and a color. We genuinely thought that Comic Sans and blue were the same thing. Despite inexperience, we were eager and wanted to expand our design skills to the real world. Fast forward to modern day and we are a well-oiled&nbsp;machine.
