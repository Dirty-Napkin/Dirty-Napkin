            <h5>As a people, we may not be able to agree on trans-Atlantic policies, but we can all agree that eating a delicious warm patty melt on a cold Friday night-out at the bar is the greatest feeling in the world. If given the opportunity, it could solve world conflicts.</h5>
            <h5>Sad that one one's given it the opportunity.</h5>

            <p class="element2">The Window is the new take-out restaurant for Philly landmark Bob &amp; Barbara’s Lounge. B&amp;B’s feels like it hasn’t changed in 60 years because it hasn’t. The Window is an extension of that feeling, just designed in 2024.</p>
            <img src="https://placehold.co/332x332.png" alt="W logo animation" class="element3">
            <p class="element4">The menu consists of classic greasy American comfort food to soak up all the drinking. Pulling from historic diners, we designed our own custom grid by– what we like to call– “goo-ifying” the squares together. This is a technical graphic design term.</p>
            <img src="https://placehold.co/332x449.png" alt="Tasty Food A-frame sign" class="element5">
            <img src="https://placehold.co/1312x636.png" alt="System creation animation" class="element6">
            <p>The color palette draws from the B&B’s interior, vintage diners, and The Window’s black storefront. You see that red standing out on South Street and you go “I want to eat a patty melt.” It’s just a natural human reaction.</p>

            <p class="element10">The food at The Window is a “twist on the classics.” This twist is not to be flashy, but modern.</p>

            <p class="element12">Reliable. Satisfying. Straight-forward and high-quality. Inspired by guilty pleasure foods. These are just a few of the words and phrases that could be used to describe the 2025 Toyota Corolla. Anyway, The Window was a super fun project and we highly recommend you visit.</p>
