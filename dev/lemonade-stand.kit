            <p class="width2">The Lemonade Stand is a theater production company that champions up-and-coming playwrights and performers in Philly. It’s essentially the same as if a child’s lemonade stand had the budget of an adult: putting in the hard work, selling your product to the community, and embracing whimsy.</p>

            <p class="vert-center width2">DIY small-scale performances attract the right groups: artists who create uniquely original pieces and an audience who actually cares about them. These shows are for the absurd, the bizarre, the silly, and the personal– anybody in the “other” category.</p>

            <p class="width6 narrow-text">We were packed with work, but AJ convinced us to take him on and we tried out a new <span class="italics">design sprint</span> model. We designed the logos over two weeks with meetings squeezed into lunch breaks, nights, and weekends. It was an absolute blast.</p>

It is an opportunity for local playwrights to share their work, and for the community to celebrate the fact that Philly is overflowing out of its butt with talent.</p>
