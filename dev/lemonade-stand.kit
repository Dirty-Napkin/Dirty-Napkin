                Our partnership with AJ and Jenny began by designing for their sold-out production of “Girlfails,” not knowing that they would return just a few months later looking for a logo and brand to kick off their first round of fundraising for The Lemonade Stand.

                    The Lemonade Stand is a theater production company that champions up-and-coming playwrights and performers in Philly. It’s as if a child’s lemonade stand had an adult’s budget: putting in the effort, selling your work to the community, and embracing&nbsp;whimsy.

                DIY small-scale performances attract the right groups: artists who create uniquely original pieces and an audience who actually cares about them. These shows are for the absurd, the bizarre, the silly, and the personal.

                We were packed with work, but AJ convinced us to take him on and we tried out a new <span class="italics">design sprint</span> model. We designed the logos in two weeks with meetings squeezed into lunch breaks, nights, and weekends. It was an absolute&nbsp;blast.

                At the core of The Lemonade Stand, Fresh Squeezed is a seasonal festival to showcase never-before-seen work-in-progress plays. It is an opportunity for local playwrights to share their work, and for the community to celebrate the fact that Philly is overflowing with&nbsp;talent.
